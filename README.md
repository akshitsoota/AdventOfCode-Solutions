## AdventOfCode Solutions

To motivate myself to start learning Python, I decided to start coding problems from a website. When I stumbled upon AdventOfCode, I knew it would be a nice place to start.

After reviewing all days, I started from Day 1 and then usually jumped around problems that I knew would be easier than others to solve.
I stopped working on AdventOfCode problems after completely working on problems of 17 days, working half-way-through on problems of 3 days. 
I didn't get a chance to start working on problems of 5 days.

This is the **completion tree** I see on AdventOfCode.com:

**It was truly fun and a great learning experience.**

I have planned to stop working on AdventOfCode and focus on websites which give topic-based questions like HackerRank. 
I also plan to work on applications for the mobile and web platform which will help me stay in touch with the latest technologies.
